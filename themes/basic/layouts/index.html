<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
This website has multiple purposes.  The first is to present articles about
projects I'm working on or trending topics in the computer field.  The second purpose--and
the more ambitious one--is to organize my notes from studying various technologies, such as
the Go language, Spring Boot, and Angular.
</p>
<p>
I think I'm like many computer professionals in that I get carried away by new technologies
as they come along.  I'll read the book, take a course, learn a great deal, make notes on my
computer.  Time goes by, and I gradually forget what I struggled so hard to learn.  If only
I had some way of maintaining what I learned, I'd feel more of a sense of mastering new
skills.
</p>
<p>
I don't think there is enough on the web about how to take good notes.
My goal with this website is to develop effective ways of maintaining technical notes and to
share what I learn.
